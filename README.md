Are you tired of Javascript? Of semicolons and curly braces?

Do you remember this other language from CS1? What was it called again. Ah yes, Python?

Have you ever thought of, wondered perhaps, or imagined using Google Sheets as a database?

## Overview

In this tutorial we're going to use a few things:
1. The Python requests library. Guaranteed much cooler than axios.
2. Google Forms and Google Sheets. Why? For our "frontend" and our "database". Yes, but why? Because...
Because Google Forms is an extremely popular way of collecting data. Yes if we were developing our own site, we would probably set up an HTML form and use an actual database. But sometimes as developers we're not the ones collecting the data. Also, think about it, you have to send out a survey real quick, do you create a Google Form, or go full stack?
3. Of course, Flask!

## Setup
1. Go [here](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) and create a Google Form. Anything really. (Or if you've created a Google Form in the past with some cool data and you'd like to reuse it, go ahead)
Here's ours! (TODO: create form)
2. Install Flask (TODO: flask installation steps/maybe github repo with everything involved)

## Step by Step

* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices

Remember to explain any notation you are using.

```javascript
/* and use code blocks for any code! */
```
